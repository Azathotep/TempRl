{"name":"Temprl","tagline":"Rough and short roguelike game written in C#","body":"### TempRL\r\n\r\nFinally a game in which you can play as a red pixel. Experience life as a red pixel scouring a dungeon for the artifact known as the Game Completion Objective.\r\n\r\n![My image](https://github.com/Azathotep/TempRl/raw/master//Img/screenshotInstruct.png)\r\n\r\nFeatures/Instructions:\r\n- Procedurally generated levels. Every game has a unique map layout.\r\n- Find the staircase on each floor (red square) to descend to the next floor.\r\n- Eight levels/floors, each a little tougher than the last.\r\n- Find generic treasure on floor 8 to win.\r\n- Avoid enemies like zombies and snakes.\r\n- Permadeath :D\r\n- Single hit point model, one bite and you are dead.\r\n- Two known bugs, one of which can crash the game (enjoy!)\r\n- Source code available https://github.com/Azathotep/TempRl (bit of a mess though)\r\n\r\nNon-Features/Notes:\r\n- Biggest flaw is it only runs on Windows at the moment until I can get it working with Mono.\r\n- Can only move in cardinal directions, ie diagonal movement is not possible.\r\n- No items\r\n- No weapons\r\n- No skills\r\n- No magic\r\n- Etc\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
