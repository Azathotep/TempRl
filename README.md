### TempRL

Finally a game in which you can play as a red pixel. Experience life as a red pixel scouring a dungeon for the artifact known as the Game Completion Objective.

Features/Instructions:
- Procedurally generated levels. Every game has a unique map layout.
- Find the staircase on each floor (red square) to descend to the next floor.
- Eight levels/floors, each a little tougher than the last.
- Find generic treasure on floor 8 to win.
- Avoid enemies like zombies and snakes.
- Permadeath :D
- Single hit point model, one bite and you are dead.
- Two known bugs, one of which can crash the game (enjoy!)
- Source code available https://github.com/Azathotep/TempRl (bit of a mess though)

Non-Features/Notes:
- Biggest flaw is it only runs on Windows at the moment until I can get it working with Mono.
- Can only move in cardinal directions, ie diagonal movement is not possible.
- No items
- No weapons
- No skills
- No magic
- Etc
