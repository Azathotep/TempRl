Marketing Blurb: Finally a game in which you can play a red pixel! Experience what it is like to be red pixel scouring a dungeon for the artifact known as the Game Completion Objective.

This was a load of code I wrote to experiment with roguelike map generation. I hacked it into a very 
rough and short game. 

Features:
-Descend 8 levels/floors, each a little tougher than the last.
-Zombies and snakes to avoid.
-Find the generic treasure on floor 8 to win.
-Procedurally generated levels. Rooms, corridors and bridges overlooking lava and caverns.
-Permadeath (obviously)
-No health (single hit point)
-Two known bugs, one of which can crash the game.

Non-Features:
-No items
-No skills
-No magic
-you get the idea

Map is renderered as solid color tiles. Might take a while to get used to, not sure the colors are intuitive.

No installer or exe at the moment. I've just shoved the source code up. Build with Visual Studio 2010 or 2012. 
Requires .Net Framework 4 to run.
